Works between 5 and 12 volts.\r\nV_I2C: Voltage reference for the I2C bus and powers components on the auxiliary bus. Must be 3.3V or 5V.\r\n\r\nThe servo has different connector groups:\r\n* Main bus (5 lines): It is used to power and control the servos in daisy-chain configuration, attaching each one's A side to the previous' B side.\r\n* Auxiliary bus (4 lines): Its function is to provide an extra link to the I2C bus, to allow other devices to be used at the same time.\r\n* Power bus (2 lines): The main bus can be powered from the power bus on any servo, or from the last servo's main bus V_BAT and GND.\r\n* Micro USB: Used both to upload the firmware to the board as to use it to control the servo directly from the PC, without involving other microcontrollers.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"Doc/Connections/Connections.png\" >\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Installing Firmware\r\nThe board runs the firmware included in the Software/Firmware section. It is written in C++ and uses Mbed, to upload it connect the board over USB and then power it using the V_BAT and GND lines while pressing the button. \r\n\r\nTo compile it use the \"mBuino\" Mbed platform, which uses the smaller LPC11U24FHI33/301 model instead of the larger LPC11U24FBD64/401 model normally used in other boards. This is important because the EEPROM memory maps are different between both and the board won't be able to access the EEPROM until the right platform is chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"Hardware/3D/IntelliServoHardware.png\" >\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n##Library\r\nThe servos are controlled over I2C, but to simplify their use an arduino library with all the relevant functions and some example sketches are included as well. \r\nTo install it simply copy it to the \"sketchbook/libraries/\" folder. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Specifications\r\nV_BAT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5V-12V\r\nV_I2C:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3V/5V\r\nI_Servo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8A max\r\nI_Line:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5A max (60mil trace)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Contributing\r\nThis project is open-source and as so everyone is welcome to contribute. The most useful way of doing so is perhaps by expanding the list of compatible servos, by finding the moving range in degrees and PID parameters specific for each servo.\r\n\r\nTo do so add the servo to the IntelliServoConfig.h file as below\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n//Added by username\r\n#ifdef NAME_OF_SERVO\r\n    float maxAngle=XXX;\r\n    float Kp=XXX, Kd=XXX, Ki=XXX;\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\nand to the IntelliServoMain.cpp file\r\n```cpp\r\n//#define NAME_OF_SERVO\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThis project is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/88x31/png/by-sa.png\" >\r\n</p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
